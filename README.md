Learn Azure DevOps with Docker and Kubernetes Deep Dive
### Prerequisites for Azure DevOps, Docker and Kubernetes on On-premises
Before you can set up Azure DevOps, Docker, and Kubernetes on-premises, you need to ensure that your infrastructure and environment meet certain prerequisites. Here are the key prerequisites for each of these components:

### Prerequisites for Azure DevOps:

1. **Server Hardware**: Ensure that you have the necessary server hardware to host Azure DevOps Server (formerly known as Team Foundation Server or TFS). This includes sufficient CPU, RAM, and storage capacity based on your organization's needs.

2. **Operating System**: Choose a Windows Server operating system that is compatible with the version of Azure DevOps Server you plan to install.

3. **SQL Server**: You will need a SQL Server instance to host the Azure DevOps Server databases. Ensure SQL Server is properly installed and configured. Azure DevOps Server supports several versions of SQL Server; check compatibility documentation for details.

4. **Active Directory**: If you plan to integrate Azure DevOps Server with your organization's Active Directory for user management, ensure that Active Directory is set up and configured correctly.

5. **Network Configuration**: Configure your network to allow communication between Azure DevOps Server, client machines, and other necessary components. Ensure that the required ports are open for inbound and outbound traffic.

6. **DNS Configuration**: Set up DNS records for the Azure DevOps Server to ensure proper domain name resolution.

7. **SSL Certificate**: Consider securing your Azure DevOps Server with an SSL certificate to enable HTTPS communication.

8. **Permissions**: Ensure that the user accounts who will administer Azure DevOps Server have the necessary permissions on the server and SQL Server databases.

### Prerequisites for Docker:

1. **Supported Operating System**: Docker is available for various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS. Ensure that your on-premises server's operating system is compatible with Docker.

2. **Hardware Virtualization**: For Windows and macOS, ensure that hardware virtualization is enabled in the BIOS/UEFI settings of your server. This is required for running Docker containers.

3. **Docker Installation**: Install Docker on your on-premises server by following the official installation instructions for your specific operating system.

4. **Docker Compose (Optional)**: If you plan to use Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications, ensure it is installed as well.

### Prerequisites for Kubernetes:

1. **Linux Nodes**: If you are setting up a Kubernetes cluster on-premises, you'll need Linux servers to act as worker nodes. Ensure these servers meet the hardware requirements for Kubernetes.

2. **Container Runtime**: Choose a container runtime compatible with Kubernetes, such as Docker, containerd, or CRI-O. Install and configure the container runtime on each worker node.

3. **Kubernetes Control Plane**: Set up a Kubernetes control plane (master node) on a dedicated server or VM. You can use Kubernetes distributions like kubeadm, kops, or Rancher to help with this setup.

4. **Networking**: Ensure that the network is correctly configured to allow communication between nodes in the cluster. Kubernetes uses a range of ports for internal communication.

5. **Container Images**: Prepare and store container images of your application in a container registry accessible to your cluster, such as Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry, or an on-premises registry.

6. **kubectl**: Install the `kubectl` command-line tool on your management machine. `kubectl` is used for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster.

7. **Security and Access Control**: Implement security best practices for your Kubernetes cluster, including role-based access control (RBAC) and network policies.

8. **Storage**: Set up storage solutions like NFS, Ceph, or local storage for persistent volumes in your Kubernetes cluster.

9. **Monitoring and Logging**: Plan for monitoring and logging solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack) to gain visibility into the cluster's performance and troubleshoot issues.

### To use Azure DevOps with Docker and Kubernetes on an on-premises Ubuntu environment, you would typically need the following Azure subscriptions and resources:

1. Azure Subscription:
   You'll need an Azure subscription to manage and orchestrate the resources you use in Azure DevOps, such as virtual machines, containers, and Kubernetes clusters. You can choose from various subscription types, including pay-as-you-go, Enterprise Agreement, or others, depending on your organization's needs.

2. Azure DevOps Organization:
   You will need an Azure DevOps organization to create and manage your pipelines, repositories, and DevOps processes. You can create an organization in Azure DevOps (formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services) by signing up for a free or paid plan.

3. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):
   If you plan to run Kubernetes workloads on Azure, you can use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). This service allows you to create, manage, and scale Kubernetes clusters in Azure. While AKS primarily targets Azure-hosted Kubernetes clusters, you can also connect AKS to on-premises Kubernetes clusters using Azure Arc. Ensure that your AKS cluster is properly configured for your on-premises environment.

4. On-Premises Ubuntu Servers:
   Your on-premises environment will require Ubuntu servers to run Docker containers and potentially host Kubernetes components if you're setting up a self-managed Kubernetes cluster. Ensure that these servers meet the hardware and software requirements for your workloads.

5. Docker:
   Install Docker on your Ubuntu servers. Docker is used to run containers, which are essential for deploying applications. You can install Docker on Ubuntu by following the official Docker documentation.

6. Kubernetes:
   If you plan to manage a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster on your Ubuntu servers, you'll need to install and configure Kubernetes components such as kubectl, kubelet, and kubeadm on each node. Refer to the Kubernetes documentation for Ubuntu-specific installation instructions.

7. Azure DevOps Agents:
   You'll need to set up Azure DevOps agents on your on-premises Ubuntu servers. These agents are responsible for executing tasks and jobs defined in your Azure DevOps pipelines. Make sure the agents are properly configured and registered with your Azure DevOps organization.

8. Azure Arc (Optional):
   If you want to manage and monitor on-premises Kubernetes clusters alongside Azure resources, you can use Azure Arc for Kubernetes. This is an optional but valuable feature that extends Azure management capabilities to on-premises clusters.

Ensure that your Azure subscription is properly configured with the necessary permissions and access rights for managing resources, and that your Ubuntu servers are securely configured for your specific workload requirements. The exact setup and configuration may vary based on your organization's needs and the specific Kubernetes and Docker solutions you plan to implement.

11. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures to protect your Kubernetes cluster and applications.

Ensure that you thoroughly review the documentation for each component and follow best practices for installation, configuration, and security to ensure a stable and secure on-premises DevOps, Docker, and Kubernetes environment.

### What is  kubeadm in kubernetes ?
`kubeadm` is a command-line tool in Kubernetes used for bootstrapping and managing Kubernetes clusters. It's designed to simplify the process of setting up a minimal, production-ready Kubernetes cluster by automating many of the manual tasks involved in cluster initialization. `kubeadm` is particularly useful for creating Kubernetes clusters quickly for testing, development, or educational purposes.

Here are some of the key functions and capabilities of `kubeadm`:

1. **Cluster Bootstrap:** `kubeadm` simplifies the process of creating a new Kubernetes cluster by automating the installation of essential components like the control plane (API server, controller manager, scheduler), worker nodes, and network plugins.

2. **Cluster Upgrades:** It can be used to upgrade an existing cluster to a newer Kubernetes version. It handles tasks like updating the control plane components and orchestrating node upgrades.

3. **Configuration Management:** `kubeadm` generates and manages the cluster's configuration files. It typically generates a kubeconfig file for the administrator, which can be used with `kubectl` to interact with the cluster.

4. **Control Plane Isolation:** You can use `kubeadm` to set up a separate control plane node, which is particularly useful in high-availability (HA) setups. This allows you to distribute the control plane components across multiple nodes for redundancy.

5. **Plugin Integration:** `kubeadm` integrates with various network and container runtime plugins, allowing you to choose the components that best suit your cluster's needs.

Here's a high-level overview of how you might use `kubeadm` to create a simple Kubernetes cluster:

1. Install Docker or another container runtime on the nodes that will become part of your cluster.

2. Install `kubeadm`, `kubelet`, and `kubectl` on each node.

3. Initialize the control plane node using `kubeadm init`. This generates a command with a token and a hash that you can run on other nodes to join them to the cluster.

4. Set up a network plugin to enable communication between pods.

5. Use `kubectl` (configured with the generated kubeconfig) to deploy applications and manage your cluster.

Keep in mind that while `kubeadm` is excellent for bootstrapping and managing clusters, it's typically used for setting up clusters for learning, development, or small-scale environments. In production or enterprise settings, you might use more complex tools like Kops, Rancher, or managed Kubernetes services like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Amazon EKS for more advanced features and robust management.

### Azure DevOps as Blue-Green Continuous Deployments
Azure DevOps provides powerful tools for implementing continuous deployment pipelines, including support for blue-green deployments. Blue-green deployments are a deployment strategy that allows you to release a new version of your application without causing downtime for your users. Here's how you can set up blue-green deployments in Azure DevOps:

1. **Azure Resource Setup**:
   - First, you need to set up the infrastructure required for blue-green deployments. This typically involves creating two separate environments: one for the current (blue) version and one for the new (green) version of your application. You can use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Azure DevTest Labs, Terraform, or Azure Resource Manager templates to automate this process.

2. **Source Control**:
   - Make sure your application code is stored in a version control system, such as Azure Repos (Git), GitHub, or Bitbucket.

3. **Azure DevOps Pipeline**:
   - Create a build pipeline that compiles and packages your application code.
   - Create a release pipeline to deploy your application to the blue environment initially.

4. **Approvals and Gates**:
   - Configure approvals and gates in your release pipeline to ensure proper testing and verification before deploying to production. You can set up automated tests and manual approvals as needed.

5. **Swap Traffic to Green**:
   - Once the green environment is successfully deployed and tested, you can use Azure Traffic Manager or Azure Application Gateway to switch traffic from the blue environment to the green environment. This effectively promotes the green environment to production.

6. **Rollback Strategy**:
   - Be prepared for rollbacks in case any issues arise with the green environment. You should have a plan in place to quickly switch traffic back to the blue environment if necessary.

7. **Monitoring and Telemetry**:
   - Implement monitoring and telemetry solutions (e.g., Azure Monitor, Application Insights) to track the health and performance of both blue and green environments. This will help you identify any issues quickly.

8. **Automate the Process**:
   - Consider automating the entire blue-green deployment process using Azure DevOps YAML pipelines and scripts. This automation ensures consistency and reduces the risk of human error.

9. **Cleanup**:
   - Once you're confident in the green environment and the blue environment is no longer needed, you can decommission or scale it down to save costs.

10. **Continuous Improvement**:
    - Regularly review and refine your blue-green deployment process to make it more efficient and reliable. Learn from past deployments and adjust your pipelines and strategies accordingly.

By following these steps and leveraging Azure DevOps tools and services, you can implement blue-green deployments for your applications, minimizing downtime and reducing the risk associated with new releases. This approach allows you to deliver updates to your users seamlessly while maintaining high availability.

### Azure DevOps Canary Deployments in Details
Canary deployments, also known as canary releases or canary testing, are a deployment strategy used in Azure DevOps (and other DevOps environments) to minimize risk when rolling out new features or changes to a production environment. The primary idea behind canary deployments is to release a new version of your application to a small subset of users or servers before deploying it to the entire production environment. This allows you to monitor the new version's performance and behavior in a real-world scenario and quickly detect and address any issues.

Here's a detailed overview of how you can implement canary deployments in Azure DevOps:

1. **Feature Development**:
   - Develop and test the new feature or change that you want to deploy.

2. **Version Control**:
   - Ensure that your code is under version control, such as Azure Repos (Git) or another source control system.

3. **Build Pipeline**:
   - Create a build pipeline that automatically builds and packages your application when changes are pushed to the version control repository.

4. **Test Automation**:
   - Set up automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and any other relevant tests, to validate the functionality and quality of your application.

5. **Release Pipeline**:
   - Create a release pipeline that deploys the application to your production environment. In the release pipeline, you'll set up multiple stages, including the canary stage.

6. **Canary Stage Configuration**:
   - Configure the canary stage of your release pipeline with the following specifics:
     - **Deployment Targets**: Specify a subset of your production environment where the new version will be deployed. This can be a percentage of users, specific servers, or a combination of both.
     - **Traffic Split**: Route a small portion of user traffic (e.g., 10%) to the canary environment where the new version is deployed, while the remaining traffic goes to the current stable version.
     - **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring and telemetry (e.g., Azure Monitor, Application Insights) to closely monitor the performance and behavior of the canary environment.

7. **Monitoring and Metrics**:
   - Monitor the canary environment closely to detect any issues, such as increased error rates, high latency, or crashes.

8. **Alerts and Thresholds**:
   - Set up alerts and thresholds for your monitoring system to notify you if the canary environment's performance or error rates exceed acceptable levels.

9. **Analysis and Decision**:
   - Continuously analyze the metrics and telemetry data from both the canary and stable environments. If the canary environment performs well and meets the acceptance criteria, proceed with the full deployment. Otherwise, roll back to the stable version if issues are detected.

10. **Full Deployment**:
    - If the canary deployment is successful and meets the criteria, gradually increase the traffic directed to the canary environment until it receives 100% of the traffic. This effectively promotes the canary release to the entire production environment.

11. **Rollback Plan**:
    - Have a well-defined rollback plan in case issues arise during the canary deployment. This plan should include steps to quickly switch all traffic back to the stable version.

12. **Post-Deployment Activities**:
    - After a successful canary deployment, continue to monitor the application in the production environment and address any post-deployment issues that may arise.

By implementing canary deployments in Azure DevOps, you can reduce the risk of deploying changes to your production environment and ensure that new features or changes do not negatively impact your users. This strategy allows for controlled and gradual releases, making it easier to catch and mitigate issues before they affect your entire user base.

### Differences between blue-green and canary deployment in tabular form
Here's a comparison of blue-green and canary deployments in a tabular form to highlight the key differences between these two deployment strategies:

| Aspect                       | Blue-Green Deployment                    | Canary Deployment                            |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Purpose                       | Minimize downtime during releases by switching between two environments. | Gradually release a new version to a subset of users or servers to mitigate risks. |
| Number of Environments        | Requires two separate environments: blue and green. | Typically uses a single environment with controlled traffic routing. |
| Initial Deployment            | The new version is fully deployed to one environment (e.g., green). | The new version is partially deployed to a subset of users or servers. |
| Traffic Routing               | Traffic is switched entirely from the old version (blue) to the new version (green). | Only a portion of user traffic is directed to the new version (canary), while the rest goes to the old version. |
| Risk Mitigation               | Reduces risk by providing a full rollback option if issues arise. | Reduces risk by limiting the impact to a subset of users or servers, allowing for quicker detection and mitigation. |
| Rollback                      | Rollback involves switching traffic back to the old version (blue). | Rollback involves redirecting all traffic away from the canary deployment. |
| Deployment Verification       | Verification often involves comparing the old (blue) and new (green) environments. | Verification focuses on monitoring and comparing the canary deployment with the stable version. |
| Suitable Scenarios           | Well-suited for applications where downtime should be avoided at all costs. | Suitable for applications where you want to test new features with a limited audience before a full release. |
| Automation and Orchestration  | Automation is typically used to switch traffic between blue and green environments. | Automation is used to control traffic routing to the canary environment and gather monitoring data. |
| Complexity                    | Simplicity in terms of environment setup but requires careful traffic switching. | More complex monitoring and traffic control setup. |
| Use Cases                     | Often used for mission-critical applications with strict uptime requirements. | Beneficial for testing new features or changes in a controlled manner, especially when the impact of changes is uncertain. |

Both blue-green and canary deployments have their own advantages and are suitable for different scenarios. Blue-green deployments are more focused on minimizing downtime and providing a clear rollback path, while canary deployments are focused on risk mitigation and early issue detection. The choice between the two strategies depends on the specific needs and goals of your deployment process.
